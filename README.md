# isozen

it's peaceful. unity 2020 + URP upgrade of isometric zen.

this unity project generates complex structures from simple animated pieces. initially this started as a sort of "fidget spinner" iphone app, and i'm now using it as the basis for generative art. i let unity generate the structures, and i then export them into blender and make them more interesting.
